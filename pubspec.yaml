# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/
     - assets/fonts/
     - assets/files/
     - assets/images/
     - assets/validateImage/

  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: iconfont
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/iconfont.ttf
   #  - family: Siyuan
